# ARABICAN HANDWRITTEN CHARACTER RECOGINITON

This project focuses on developing a robust solution for recognizing handwritten Arabican letters from diverse datasets. Leveraging deep learning techniques, the system processes both image and CSV-based data to accurately categorize handwritten characters, making a significant step towards automating document processing for Arabican scripts.

**Key Features:**

Comprehensive Data Visualization: Utilized Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly to perform in-depth exploratory data analysis and visualize key characteristics of both image and CSV datasets, ensuring a thorough understanding of the data distribution.

**Artificial Neural Network (ANN) Model:** Designed and trained an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model using Python for precise categorization of handwritten Arabican letters.

**Rigorous Model Evaluation:** Implemented methods to visualize model accuracy and performance metrics, followed by rigorous testing on unseen data to validate the model's efficacy and generalization capabilities.

**Data Handling:** Capable of processing and interpreting data from both raw image files and structured CSV formats.
